## Assignments

For each subject: study the material and try out the examples to get experience with is.
Install all the mentioned software and experiment.
Also look around on internet and on the other supplied source the get more information.

The idea is that we start with a simple smart contract that we are building out during the classes.
So put some thought in your first smart contract.
This could be:
- a small game
- a mini registration (database)


Provide prove of what you have done by putting the source code and/or a screen shot on github:
